<p><img src='iitk.gif'align="right">Unlike convolution, Fourier domain processing, often provides quantitative and <br>
intuitive insight into the nature of the noise process, which is useful in designing <br>
noise cleaning spatial filters. As an example, Figure 10.3-6a shows an original<br>
image subject to periodic interference. Its two-dimensional Fourier transform, <br>
shown in Figure 10.3-6b, exhibits a strong response at the two points in the Fourier <br>
plane corresponding to the frequency response of the interference. When multiplied <br>
point by point with the Fourier transform of the original image, the bandstop filter of
Figure 10.3-6c attenuates the interference energy in the Fourier domain. Figure <br>
10.3-6d shows the noise-cleaned result obtained by taking an inverse Fourier transform <br>
of the product.</p>
